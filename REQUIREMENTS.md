#Implement a basic Tic Tac Toe game:

```_X_|___|___ ```

```___|_X_|___ ```

```___|___|_X_```

##Basic requirements: 
* Two users play a game of tick-tack-toe on the same computer 
* No real-time functionality is required 
* Single session 
* All actions are reported to the API, which saves them 
* Action log is displayed underneath the game area, read from the API 
* The game must resume completely if the browser is refreshed

What you should use: 
* React + Redux
* Node.js
* Docker 
* Anything else you want.

##Notes: 
- No need for any fancy styles. Plain and simple with the least amount of effort.
- Layout must be done using flexbox. 
- The result of the task must be a link to two Github repos, containing both frontend and API project sources and readme 
- At least one meaningful automated test present per project with the framework of your choice
- Using seeds or anything else that will get you started faster is allowed and encouraged :)
